## The possibilities of a choreography: creating through digital media

Ufuk Şenel and Ekin Tunçeli,
who have formed a collaboration to start their work in May under PURESPACE,
will be approaching their new project through the possibilities of today.
From this research perspective,
they aim to experience the familiar production parameters
along with the current ones over a virtual environment,
by approaching the extraordinary situations introduced into our lives
through the times we are living in.

They will do a live broadcast of their work they are calling
The possibilities of a choreography: creating through digital media
via an online platform
on Tuesdays and Fridays between 16:00-18:00 every week
and they will also record it on that platform.
In this project, besides witnessing the production stage of the work,
the audience will also be able to contribute to the ongoing creative process.
When the project is completed, the performance will meet with its audience
both in a physical location and on an online platform.


## Co-Solo<a name="cosolo"></a>

As PURESPACE, in the Co-Solo project we initiated,
we will be hosting artists from the performing  arts discipline
every Wednesday and Friday during May.

The Co-Solo project is a proposal
which we hope will shape itself in a reality, in which we are meeting
almost all our needs and living our lives on virtual media.
It is also a platform that allows artists working in these fields
to seek answers to uncertainties or questions
about the conditions and circumstances under which they will survive.

How does a perfectly empty and safe space remain valid
during a time in which we are discussing globally
how all forms of art will survive?
And with the new ways of perception we are acquiring now,
what can we rebuild in these spaces in which we have existed
all throughout our lives.
With these questions in mind, we started this project.
We will be sharing 60 minute online streams
of the artistic articulations of the invited artists
either from their homes, or from PS02, our studio at Bomonti.
In this project, in which space and its relationship with art
is placed at the center and where the today
and the future of this relationship are discussed,
through the sharings made by the artists with different artistic views,
based on their own modes of existence,
maybe we will not find all the answers
but we will learn to ask the right questions.
And by developing an awareness of the new reality brought on by the now,
we will continue to move and produce.
