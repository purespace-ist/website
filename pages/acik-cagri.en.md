# OPEN CALL

## House is me

PURESPACE is a multidisciplinary and inclusive formation that leads and archives creative transformation in all cultural and artistic disciplines.
It creates its own fields of study and research through thematic concepts. It organizes workshops and national/international guest artist programs,
featuring body-focused studies and research. It offers space for displaying the works of today's artists. It creates meeting points. It builds bridges
for research and experience using both current and traditional methods.

We, as PURESPACE, find it valuable in terms of creating a memory, to make the eclipses we are experiencing now visible on a creative platform and
then to turn it into an archive through our project House is me.

During this time that we are staying inside voluntarily, in our homes as a space, how do we relate to ourselves, to our body, and to all the things
we interact with? How do the new distance and proximity definitions arising during this time, when the real and the virtual are interchanged, reflect on us?

In order to build an archive of these times in which we are all experiencing staying home, we are making an open call to you. You can contribute to this
archive by sending in your performances that reflect this whole process and that you have created with your own means at home during this time.

During the first stage of this project, we will present the submitted works on an online viewing platform. Then, we aim to turn this platform into an
archive, so all that is now will be remembered. When we are able to safely go back outside, we will organize a night at PURESPACE’s studio ps02
in Bomonti to celebrate being together again and the potential the echoes of what we just lived through holds for turning into new collaborations.
Ultimately, we aim to provide both social awareness and sustainability of the project by displaying House is me project at locations such as
Istanbul, Ankara, Eskişehir and İzmir at certain intervals.

You can send videos of your performances (maximum length is 10 minutes), related explanation texts and a short artist bio
to purespace@purespace.ist at the latest by May 30, 2020. You can also contact us at this e-mail address for your questions.
